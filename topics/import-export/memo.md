## **Analyze**

- Low-code can only interact with files in workspace, not with external files.
- Only the module's PICK and some tools can interact with external files.
  - Both of these methods will add setup items to the installation once the external file is specified.
  - In addition to specifying external files, we can use document variables so that they do not add to the setup items during installation.
    - But the file variable must be a .txt file with a value written in it.
      - This way if you need a lot of document variables will prepare a lot of .txt files.

## **Goal**

- Reduce the number of setup items during installation.
- Reduce the number of .txt files to be prepared.

## **Practice Example**
