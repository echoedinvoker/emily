- Boundary arg of combined CROP APIs has **wait** property to set timout just like waitFor.
- get screen size

  - purpose?

- get correct relative coordinates.
- react coordinate is difference from normal boundary.
- get screen snapshot.
  - use CROP to set area.
    - need to aware that we have risk to use CROP compare to simple coordinates.
- why I prefer waitFor, instead of find.
